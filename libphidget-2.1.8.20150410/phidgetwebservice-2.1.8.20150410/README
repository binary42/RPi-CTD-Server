                          Phidget Webservice
                    Version 2.1.8, 22 February 2011

Installation
============

./configure; make; make install

   This installs the phidgetwebservice21 executable. Avahi zeroconf
support is compiled in by default and runtime-linked when available.
	
Requirements
============

libphidget21

Options
=======

   Configure options:
   
   To use mdnsresponder instead of avahi for zeroconf:
   
     ./configure --enable-zeroconf=bonjour
	 
   To disable zeroconf completely:
   
     ./configure --disable-zeroconf

Usage
=====

   'phidgetwebservice21 -h' to see options.

FreeBSD
=======

   The Webservice has been tested on FreeBSD and found to work.
However, the configure line must be modified:

     ./configure LIBS=/usr/lib/libphidget21.so CFLAGS=-pthread
	 
   This assumes that libphidget21 is installed to its default location
of /usr/lib. Sometimes, the configure script cannot find libphidget21,
so we specify it explicitely. We also add the -pthread switch which is
required by FreeBSD for compiling with threads.

   Building / installation is the same as on Linux:
   
     make; make install
